        <h3>Personality Types</h3>
        <p>Among our group we have a variety of personality types, and with the information available we have been able to ascertain how we can operate as an effective team.</p>
        <p>We have leader types to propel the group forward and keep communication open, a support type to offer assistance to group members who may be struggling and keep us on track, an assertive logistician type to create and maintain a direct plan of action, and a virtuoso type who will be willing to explore ideas and concepts others may not be so quick to identify.</p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
        <p>We have a variety of different learning styles in our team. This will be extremely beneficial in the sense that we will be able to assist each other on topics of study. If somebody in the team is unable to grasp a concept due to the manner in which it is presented, the chance of others being able to explain it is far greater than if we all possessed the same learning style.</p>

        <h3>Individual Tests</h3>
        <p>The separate tests undertaken provide good insight into what we each can bring to the team outside of the standard learning conventions. Whether it be high situational awareness or openness to delve into all aspects of working as a team, they show that we can each offer a unique trait to this group environment.</p>

        <h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>

        <div class="flex">
            <div class="flex-group">
                <span>Benjamin Rodd</span>
                <span>Data Administrator</span>

                <span>Software Engineer</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Within our team, we have a broad scope of ideal jobs within the IT industry. Our job titles and roles are very different from one another, with the exception of Felipe and Jake.</p>

        <p>The direct differences of these roles are evident within the job title, with the likes of data, web development, software engineering, and support; however, their uses have several overlapping qualities.</p>

        <h3>Job Qualities</h3>
        <div class="flex">
            <div class="flex-group">
                <span>Benjamin Rodd</span>
                <span>Analytical, Planning & Strategy</span>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-group">
                <span>Christopher Searson</span>
                <span>Creative, Development</span>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-group">
                <span>Felipe Andrade De Oliveira Silva</span>
                <span>Development, Planning and Strategy</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>As different as  our roles are, they still have similar skillsets, both technical and general, which shows how broad and adaptive the IT industry can be. They all contain a base knowledge of software and programming and require good communication and problem-solving skills. The differences however, are in how these skills are utilised in the specific roles.</p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Based on our experiences from assignment two we approached this assignment in a similar manner in relation to the tools we would be using to communicate and share ideas. The one advantage of continuing on the path we were on was the ability to expand on our use of tools that we were previously experiencing for the first time, utilising methods and features of these tools that we were not yet familiar with. </p>

        <h3>Tools used for this assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Canvas</b> – While we still used Canvas for basic announcements and submission purposes, we did not need to access it as much in assignment three. Having already established alternate means of communication, which were now being used often and effectively, our reliance on Canvas became minimal in terms of this assignment.</li>
            <li><b>MS Teams</b> – Microsoft Teams was once again our primary communication tool throughout this assignment. Teams’ ability to make communicating and sharing input in different ways is extremely valuable when undertaking an assignment like this, where team members are in different areas of the country. With all three of us on the same page with this assignment it was utilised far more effectively than it was in assignment two where inactive members were a problem. We held team video calls weekly, communicated via messages daily, and established a good working relationship through these methods. </li>
            <li><b>Trello</b> – We did not start using Trello until a couple of weeks into assignment two, so we were a bit unfamiliar about how to best utilise it in a team environment. Through our experiences we developed a good method of uploading and reviewing each other’s work, all while keeping the task board clear and easy to manage. It was once again our primary tool for organising, uploading, and viewing the assignment content. It provided us a more in-depth and clear scheduling overview than Teams, so by using it alongside the communication aspect of Teams it really helped us to remain organised.</li>
            <li><b>GitHub</b> – GitHub has become a very useful tool for us throughout these assignments, it has provided us a repository to upload and share our work with each other in a more version-controlled environment than other tools. We utilised GitHub more in this assignment than assignment two as the three of us were actively communicating and contributing more often as we didn’t have to follow up with members who were not.</li>
        </ul>


        
        <p><b>Team Git Repository:</b> <a class="git-link" href="https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3" target="_blank">https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3</a></p>
    </div>

<section class="tools-2 block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <p>
            For assignment three the GitHub repository was utilised more often than assignment two, with all three members being active in contributing to the assignment this time around it was easier to manage and monitor and the audit reflects the work that was done more accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as was the case with assignment two, it was used as a storage, version, and organisational tool alongside other platforms so it does not completely reflect the complete discourse and file sharing that took part during this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilising other tools around GitHub made it a good place to store and version control completed drafts and content however, we found that tools like Teams and Trello were better for giving input and direct feedback.
