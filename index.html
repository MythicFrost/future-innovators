        <h3>Career Plans</h3>

        <p>As was the case with our ideal jobs, our career plans cover a large scope of the IT industry. We each have different interests which have influenced these intended plans; however, progressing through this subject has given us all an understanding and comprehension as to how to make these plans a reality. </p>

        <p>While the differences between our career plans are laid bare in the definition alone, the one thing that has become apparent to us throughout this subject though is that many careers within the IT industry contain similar base skills and knowledge. SQL for instance was heavily required for all three of our ideal job titles while other skills such as JavaScript and Python were apparent across at least two of our roles. This showed us how transferable skills across different areas of the industry can be and how valuable learning different skills is.</p>

        <p>While none of our career plans have drastically changed through assignments one or two, we have all begun to recognise the value in expanding our knowledge within the industry to make a larger number of roles within our preferred area available to us. Focusing on only a specific role or skillset can really narrow your chances of growing within the industry, something that is constantly required. Through the Burning Glass data exercise, we all identified that it is essential to maintain a healthy awareness of industry skills as many are applicable in multiple areas. By doing this the opportunities within a preferred career multiply but also the opportunity to evolve and change careers becomes far more achievable.</p>

        <h3>Group Processes</h3>

        <p>Assignment two was a very valuable learning experience for the three of us as we were able to see firsthand the impact of ineffective communication and lack of contribution. While the group had initially set early goals and tasks, a couple of members had poor communication and continually delayed delivering what they had promised each week. A few days before the deadline, we still had not received any content from them and the other members needed to enter a crunch period to get everything done in time.</p>

        <p>The communication between the three of us was great; we met for video chats weekly and often communicated daily via text chat. Despite being told continually by the former members of the group that they'd start working on their content and get it to us, we did not wait around for them and instead moved on to the next tasks at hand that we could complete. This choice saved us at the end, because if we had waited for them to finish their tasks before we moved on to our next tasks, there would have been too much work to do at the end to complete the assignment in time.</p>
        <p>About a week prior to the deadline we contacted Anthony Clapp about the lack of deliverables from the former members, as we were quite nervous at this stage. We trusted that they would deliver their work, but in hindsight, contacting Anthony even a few days earlier would have been better. When it was discovered that the two former members had not even started working on the project, they were removed from the group. Although it was a lot of extra work, it gave us confidence in ourselves moving forward together with assignment three.</p>
        
        <p>Even though at this stage we are all completely confident in each other's ability to communicate and deliver what is required for the assignment, we held a discussion on how we could further improve communication between us. We identified three things that would help this further:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consistent communication on MS Teams – While it is an unrealistic expectation to be able to monitor Teams 24/7, we agreed that even just briefly checking it each day to see any updates or problems that may have arisen would keep us all informed, eliminating the stress of assumption. We also agreed that if we were unable to be contacted for a period of time, we would let the team know in advance. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Weekly video meetings – Although we did utilise the use of video calls in assignment two it was only two or three times, and only briefly. This time around we agreed that at least one video chat per week would be beneficial to the assignment as it promoted a more dynamic and free flowing way of not only sharing ideas but expanding on them too. The video meetings were also a good way to ease any fears about how the assignment was progressing as we were able to openly communicate about any problems we had encountered and resolve them instantly rather than waiting for the last minute to address them.
            </li>
            <li>
                More file sharing – During assignment two we worked on our tasks and then shared our files when we thought we had completed them. This time around we decided to share our work earlier and more often to be able to receive and action on the feedback from the other team members while still developing the content. This allowed for a more cohesive assignment and took all the stress out of having to go through everything last minute as we had all already had our input on the content we were submitting. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While there are still more ways in which we could have improved on our experience from assignment two, these three process changes made assignment three far more productive and cohesive, and far less stressful in delivering the finished assignment.</p>

<section class="tools block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Based on our experiences from assignment two we approached this assignment in a similar manner in relation to the tools we would be using to communicate and share ideas. The one advantage of continuing on the path we were on was the ability to expand on our use of tools that we were previously experiencing for the first time, utilising methods and features of these tools that we were not yet familiar with. </p>

        <h3>Tools used for this assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Canvas</b> – While we still used Canvas for basic announcements and submission purposes, we did not need to access it as much in assignment three. Having already established alternate means of communication, which were now being used often and effectively, our reliance on Canvas became minimal in terms of this assignment.</li>
            <li><b>MS Teams</b> – Microsoft Teams was once again our primary communication tool throughout this assignment. Teams’ ability to make communicating and sharing input in different ways is extremely valuable when undertaking an assignment like this, where team members are in different areas of the country. With all three of us on the same page with this assignment it was utilised far more effectively than it was in assignment two where inactive members were a problem. We held team video calls weekly, communicated via messages daily, and established a good working relationship through these methods. </li>
            <li><b>Trello</b> – We did not start using Trello until a couple of weeks into assignment two, so we were a bit unfamiliar about how to best utilise it in a team environment. Through our experiences we developed a good method of uploading and reviewing each other’s work, all while keeping the task board clear and easy to manage. It was once again our primary tool for organising, uploading, and viewing the assignment content. It provided us a more in-depth and clear scheduling overview than Teams, so by using it alongside the communication aspect of Teams it really helped us to remain organised.</li>
            <li><b>GitHub</b> – GitHub has become a very useful tool for us throughout these assignments, it has provided us a repository to upload and share our work with each other in a more version-controlled environment than other tools. We utilised GitHub more in this assignment than assignment two as the three of us were actively communicating and contributing more often as we didn’t have to follow up with members who were not.</li>
        </ul>


        
        <p><b>Team Git Repository:</b> <a class="git-link" href="https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3" target="_blank">https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3</a></p>
    </div>

<section class="tools-2 block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <p>
            For assignment three the GitHub repository was utilised more often than assignment two, with all three members being active in contributing to the assignment this time around it was easier to manage and monitor and the audit reflects the work that was done more accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as was the case with assignment two, it was used as a storage, version, and organisational tool alongside other platforms so it does not completely reflect the complete discourse and file sharing that took part during this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilising other tools around GitHub made it a good place to store and version control completed drafts and content however, we found that tools like Teams and Trello were better for giving input and direct feedback.
