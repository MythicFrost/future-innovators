        <h3>Career Plans</h3>

        <p>As was the case with our ideal jobs, our career plans cover a large scope of the IT industry. We each have different interests which have influenced these intended plans; however, progressing through this subject has given us all an understanding and comprehension as to how to make these plans a reality. </p>

        <p>While the differences between our career plans are laid bare in the definition alone, the one thing that has become apparent to us throughout this subject though is that many careers within the IT industry contain similar base skills and knowledge. SQL for instance was heavily required for all three of our ideal job titles while other skills such as JavaScript and Python were apparent across at least two of our roles. This showed us how transferable skills across different areas of the industry can be and how valuable learning different skills is.</p>

        <p>While none of our career plans have drastically changed through assignments one or two, we have all begun to recognise the value in expanding our knowledge within the industry to make a larger number of roles within our preferred area available to us. Focusing on only a specific role or skillset can really narrow your chances of growing within the industry, something that is constantly required. Through the Burning Glass data exercise, we all identified that it is essential to maintain a healthy awareness of industry skills as many are applicable in multiple areas. By doing this the opportunities within a preferred career multiply but also the opportunity to evolve and change careers becomes far more achievable.</p>

    <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Group Processes</h3>
        <p>During assignment two we had a couple of issues with some of the team members revolving around communication but also delivery of work. Although the remaining members of the team are reliable, we still agreed to communicate regularly and provide deliverables as we go.</p>
        <p>From the outset of this assignment we established that MS Teams would be the primary source of communication, as it was with assignment two, expressing ideas and contributing feedback on content. We also utilised Trello more heavily than in assignment two as it provides a great way to review content and to see how each team member is progressing with completing their tasks. Having the constant ability to share and communicate ideas is crucial in the success of any project so this was a good chance for us to develop our skills in contributing and providing feedback on other’s ideas and input.</p>
        
        <h4>Frequency</h4>
        <p>From the outset we established that daily checks of MS Teams would be required; this was not a directive to work every day, more an exercise to make sure that we are constantly aware of any issues or problems that may have arisen with any of our tasks. This could be just a brief check on messages sent – a reply may or may not be required; however, often text communication occurred on a daily basis.</p>
        
        <p>We agreed that at least two video chats a week in MS Teams would be beneficial to the project as it created a freer form way of communicating our thoughts and ideas, expanding on our dialogue within the messages. In these meetings we would discuss our individual tasks and also elaborate on any material or research that may have been undertaken since the last meeting. Being from different locations across the country this proved to be essential in compiling all of our content in a manner that was agreeable for everyone, it was invaluable given that face to face meetings were not possible.</p>
        
        <h4>Communication Issues</h4>
        <p>Accountability was one of the first things we discussed moving into this assignment, we needed to be responsible for our own ability to contribute or be available for open communication. We all agreed to let the group know or at least give a warning in advance if a team member were to be unavailable for a period of time during the week.</p>
        
        <p>If communication were to break down, we would try making contact via different means such as Canvas announcements or email to make sure it is not just an issue with Teams. If no contact could be made within 72 hours of the alternate means, the members communicating would first flag this with the course supervisor, making them aware that there may be an issue. After doing this as a precaution, the other members would begin discussing contingencies as to how to divide the required tasks among themselves should the issue not be resolved.</p>
        
        <p>We learned the lesson in assignment two that it is better to plan alternative solutions as a situation evolves, rather than when you have a definitive knowledge of a member not communicating, as it is much easier to react to such a situation if you are already prepared for it.</p>
        <p>The one way we prepared for any issues in this area was to not dedicate any one specific job to a single member, if that member were unable to contribute a large section of the project would be missing. By each taking responsibility for aspects of the assignment, and not complete sections, it allowed us the freedom to have the project keep moving forward even in the event of a communication breakdown.</p>

<section class="tools block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Based on our experiences from assignment two we approached this assignment in a similar manner in relation to the tools we would be using to communicate and share ideas. The one advantage of continuing on the path we were on was the ability to expand on our use of tools that we were previously experiencing for the first time, utilising methods and features of these tools that we were not yet familiar with. </p>

        <h3>Tools used for this assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Canvas</b> – While we still used Canvas for basic announcements and submission purposes, we did not need to access it as much in assignment three. Having already established alternate means of communication, which were now being used often and effectively, our reliance on Canvas became minimal in terms of this assignment.</li>
            <li><b>MS Teams</b> – Microsoft Teams was once again our primary communication tool throughout this assignment. Teams’ ability to make communicating and sharing input in different ways is extremely valuable when undertaking an assignment like this, where team members are in different areas of the country. With all three of us on the same page with this assignment it was utilised far more effectively than it was in assignment two where inactive members were a problem. We held team video calls weekly, communicated via messages daily, and established a good working relationship through these methods. </li>
            <li><b>Trello</b> – We did not start using Trello until a couple of weeks into assignment two, so we were a bit unfamiliar about how to best utilise it in a team environment. Through our experiences we developed a good method of uploading and reviewing each other’s work, all while keeping the task board clear and easy to manage. It was once again our primary tool for organising, uploading, and viewing the assignment content. It provided us a more in-depth and clear scheduling overview than Teams, so by using it alongside the communication aspect of Teams it really helped us to remain organised.</li>
            <li><b>GitHub</b> – GitHub has become a very useful tool for us throughout these assignments, it has provided us a repository to upload and share our work with each other in a more version-controlled environment than other tools. We utilised GitHub more in this assignment than assignment two as the three of us were actively communicating and contributing more often as we didn’t have to follow up with members who were not.</li>
        </ul>


        
        <p><b>Team Git Repository:</b> <a class="git-link" href="https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3" target="_blank">https://github.com/s3866950/Assignment3</a></p>

<section class="tools-2 block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <p>
            For assignment three the GitHub repository was utilised more often than assignment two, with all three members being active in contributing to the assignment this time around it was easier to manage and monitor and the audit reflects the work that was done more accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as was the case with assignment two, it was used as a storage, version, and organisational tool alongside other platforms so it does not completely reflect the complete discourse and file sharing that took part during this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilising other tools around GitHub made it a good place to store and version control completed drafts and content however, we found that tools like Teams and Trello were better for giving input and direct feedback.
